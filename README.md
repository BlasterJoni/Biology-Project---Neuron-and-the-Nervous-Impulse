# Neuron and the Nervous Impulse - Biology Project

##About:
This is the repository for my Biology Project. The project consists in somehow represent the nervous impulse. My aproach to this project is to make a model of a neuron or two and with an arduino make a led circuit to represent the nervous impulse passing by.

## Circuit and code:
![Circuit](https://puu.sh/qVBfU/095140a673.png "Circuit")

[Here](arduino.c) is the code behind it.

And here is a simulation of the circuit in [circuits.io](https://circuits.io/circuits/2638171-biology-project).
